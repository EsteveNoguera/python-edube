# Python projects
Projects done during the courses offered by the Python Institute

## 1. [Final project for PCEP Certified Entry-Level Python Programme](https://github.com/EsteveNoguera/python-edube/blob/main/tic_tac_toe.py)

The course proposes to do a tic-tac-toe. You can check my approach for this [here](https://github.com/EsteveNoguera/python-edube/blob/main/tic_tac_toe.py). Although it works as intended, things that may possibly need an improvement are: 

1. Add a dynamic way to get all possible positions instead of hard coding them into a variable. This could help to extend the code into bigger boards
2. Allow the machine to start randomly instead of always center, or even let the user start. 
3. Make a 2 player version
4. And probably much more...

### 1.1. How to run it?

#### Linux
Download tic_tac_toe.py script. Open a terminal and go where the script is saved and run the following command:
>python tic_tac_toe.py
You can always use any IDE of your choice (PyCharm, Spyder...).

#### Windows
Download tic_tac_toe.py script and use any Python IDE of your choice (PyCharm, Spyder...).
