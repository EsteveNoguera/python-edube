Projects done during the courses offered by the Python Institute

## 1. Final project for PCEP Certified Entry-Level Python Programme

The course proposes to do a tic-tac-toe. You can check my approach for this [here](https://github.com/EsteveNoguera/python-edube/blob/main/tic_tac_toe.py). Although it works as intended, things that may possibly need an improvement are: 

1. Add a dynamic way to get all possible positions instead of hard coding them into a variable. This could help to extend the code into bigger boards
2. Allow the machine to start randomly instead of always center, or even let the user start. 
3. Make a 2 player version
4. And probably much more..
