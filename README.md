Projects done during the courses offered by the Python Institute

## 1. Final project for PCEP Certified Entry-Level Python Programme

The course proposes to do a tic-tac-toe. You can check my approach for this [here](https://github.com/EsteveNoguera/python-edube/blob/main/tic_tac_toe.py). Although it works as intended, things that may possibly need an improvement are: 

1. Add a dynamic way to get all possible positions instead of hard coding them into a variable. This could help to extend the code into bigger boards
2. Clean up of the function victory_for(). Find a way of checking rows/columns and diagonals at the same time would make the code clenaer.
3. And probably way more things!
